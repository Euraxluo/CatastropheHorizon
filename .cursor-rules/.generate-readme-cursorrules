# Module README Generator for Exploding Cats GameFi

## Task Description

You're tasked with creating comprehensive README files for the modules of the Exploding Cats GameFi project, a blockchain-based card game. Each README should explain the module's purpose, functionality, and integration with the larger system to help developers (both current and future) understand the codebase.

## Context

The Exploding Cats GameFi codebase is complex with multiple interconnected modules. Each module serves a specific purpose within the game's architecture. These READMEs will serve as documentation to help developers navigate and understand the codebase efficiently.

## Input Format

I will provide you with:

- The path to a specific module folder (e.g., `/app/dashboard/components`)
- A directory listing showing all files and subdirectories within the module
- Access to key files through file attachments or code snippets

## Output Requirements

Create a comprehensive README.md file with the following sections:

1. **Module Overview**: Write 2-3 concise sentences describing the module's primary purpose and importance within the system.

2. **Core Functionality**: Create a bullet list (4-6 items) of the main capabilities this module provides. Format each bullet as "**Name**: Description".

3. **Key Components**: Organize components by category (e.g., by subdirectory or functional area). For each key file/class, include:
   - File name with extension
   - Brief description of its purpose
   - Key functionality it provides
4. **Dependencies**: List both internal module dependencies and external libraries with a brief explanation of how they're used.

5. **Usage Examples**: Provide 1-2 code examples showing how the module is typically used within the system. Use realistic variable names and include comments.

6. **Architecture Notes**: Explain the design patterns, data flow, and architectural decisions. Include a mermaid diagram when the module has complex interactions.

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, technically precise language appropriate for experienced developers
- Focus on high-level functionality rather than implementation details
- Maintain a neutral, informative tone
- Structure information hierarchically with clear headings and subheadings
- Use bold formatting for emphasis on key terms
- Keep the entire README under 1000 words for quick reference
- Include a mermaid diagram for modules with complex interactions or data flows
- Use terminology relevant to GameFi, blockchain, and Web3 development
